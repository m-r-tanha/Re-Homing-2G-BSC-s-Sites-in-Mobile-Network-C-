# Re-Homing 2G BSCs Sites in Mobile Networks
This code has been developed at 2010 in MCI Mobile Network ( a Mobile network wit around 50 Million Subscribers)
To change the Mobile networks it needs to change the Sites' BSC, as far as you know each site has its own configuration and parameters, which have been changed during the long period, and they should copay to the new BSC.
This code export the dump from the BSC, and extract each parameter from a huge database and finally create a command set to implement in the new BSC.
Before this code, all these time-consuming tasks have been done manually, but based on this code this procedure was automated.
